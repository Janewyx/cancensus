# r-censusmapper
R wrapper for calling CensusMapper APIs

This project provides a wrapper function for CensusMapper API calls from R to query specific census data and geographies for use in R.

The CensusMapper API is still in beta, the use of the CensusMapper API requires API keys, which can be obtained from [CensusMapper](https://CensusMapper.ca) by emailing Jens.

The html version of the notbook can be viewed [on the CensusMapper](https://censusmapper.ca/r-censusmapper-demo.html).
